This site is using the Terminal Hugo theme. it currently looks very orange. 
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241130181341.png)


I want to change that, and there appears to be a tool available to do that very easily at https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/

This site is unfortunately not working right now, I put in an issue [here](https://github.com/panr/terminal-css/issues/2)

Hopefully the site gets fixed, if not I will have to figure out how to do this manually.
