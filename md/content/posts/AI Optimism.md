This morning, JD Vance gave a speech about AI at the AI Action Summit in Paris.
I wanted to share this speech because it describes almost exactly how I feel about AI, stated more eloquently than I could.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going to change the world. If the previous administration's war on AI had continued, the US would have quickly fallen behind the rest of the world in every way. The Trump administration, or at least Vance, has a view on the topic that remains optimistic for America and humanity.

Be sure to give his speech a listen:

A quick note on jobs being taken by AI: A recent study from Anthropic seems to indicate that AI is currently augmenting, not replacing, human workforces.

"*The future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about AI safety. It will be won by building.*" â€“ JD Vance
