Here is a list of some of the AIs out there. Will probably be outdated next week

# Grok
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222143903.png)
https://grok.com, no account needed, good free tier, generates images

Grok 3 is (as of right now) the best AI available to the public. The deepsearch mode is the best way to research anything on the internet right now. Something finally beat Claude Sonnet 3.5 new.

# Perplexity
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222144748.png)
https://pplx.ai, no account needed, ok free tier

Perplexity a fantastic search engine. It cites sources well, and has a great team behind it.

# Claude
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222145018.png)
https://claude.ai, account needed, terrible free tier

Claude is made by Anthropic, a company focused on AI safety. It was easily the best model until Grok 3 came out. It is fantastic at writing and coding.

# CHAT.com by OpenAI
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222145522.png)
https://chat.com, no account needed, good free tier, generates images

Also known as ChatGPT by everyone other than me, the OG chatbot is still really good.

# Gemini
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222145727.png)
https://gemini.google.com/, google account needed, good free tier, generates images

The worst place to use gemini is the official website. I like using it as an assistant on android phones, with the API, or in perplexity or t3 chat. The gemini 2.0 flash model is incredible, but the official site is just not great.

# Le Chat

https://chat.mistral.ai/chat

Its french

# Copiliot
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222150451.png)
https://copilot.microsoft.com/

A ChatGPT wrapper, but a really good one

---
# T3 Chat
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222150645.png)
https://t3.chat, no account needed, ok free tier

My favorite wrapper for lots of LLMs. t3 chat is also very fast. the team is always adding new features.

# ImageFX
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222151102.png)
https://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx. only does images

Probably the best image generator out there. its really good. Completely free

---
# LM Studio
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222151140.png)
https://lmstudio.ai/, run AI locally

This is how I recommend most people run LLMs locally (and I recommend everybody run AI locally.) It will recommend models that your computer can handle and has a good interface. 

---
# Ollama
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250222151433.png)
https://ollama.com/, run AI locally

Ollama is a great way to run LLMs locally. It does everything through the CLI, but it isn't hard to learn how to use it.

Check back soon, I may update this list once in a while
