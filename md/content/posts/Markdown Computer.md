LLMs like markdown, humans like markdown.  

The idea is to build a "computer" or a framework and set of apps that are all based in markdown so that a LLM can operate it as well as a human can. The software will also include a CLI so the LLM and Human can run commands

The system prompts set up for the LLM will include lots of system data, including the majority of the main directory as to remain efficient

The LLM can be whatever you choose, using OpenAI compatible APIs

The LLM will have a dedicated folder for it to write notes and instructions for itself in

Each file will include some metadata meant for the LLM, not the human, including generated summaries and notes, as to make finding files and interpreting them easier and more token efficient for the LLM

Eventually, this software will include email, some messaging apps, calendar, web browser, and of course word processor with the majority of the interface and content being in markdown

IDK how images and videos are going to work yet

I'm very happy about this. this will make it pretty easy to make the rest of the GUI

 I got a basic layout implemented
 need to remember that the system prompt needs to include the page currently open
