      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, JD Vance gave this speech about AI at the AI Action Summit in Paris.
I wanted to share this speech because it describes almost exactly how I feel about AI, stated in a more eloquently way than i could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Technology is going to change the world, and if the previous administration&amp;rsquo;s war on AI had continued, the US would have quickly fallen behind the rest of the world in every way. The Trump administration, or at least Vance has a view on the topic that remains optimistic for America and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to give his speech a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an quick note on jobs being taken by  AI. A recent study from Anthropic seems too indicate that AI is currently augmenting, not replacing human work forces.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The future is not going to be won by hand wringing about AI safety. It will be won by building.&amp;rdquo; - JD Vance&lt;/p&gt;
