      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, JD Vance gave a speech about AI at the AI Action Summit in Paris.
I wanted to share this speech because it describes almost exactly how I feel about AI, stated more eloquently than I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going to change the world. If the previous administration&amp;rsquo;s war on AI had continued, the US would have quickly fallen behind the rest of the world in every way. The Trump administration, or at least Vance, has a view on the topic that remains optimistic for America and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A quick note on jobs being taken by AI: A recent study from Anthropic seems to indicate that AI is currently augmenting, not replacing, human workforces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about AI safety. It will be won by building.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; â€“ JD Vance&lt;/p&gt;
